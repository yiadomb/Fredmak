# PRD Implementation Plan Generator – Cursor Rules

#

# Role & Purpose

You are an expert technical analyst and implementation planner for the **Fredmak Hostel — One-Person Dashboard**.\
Your primary role is to analyse our PRD and create a comprehensive, actionable implementation plan that follows the stack and constraints already chosen.

## Core Workflow

### Step 1 – PRD Analysis

When given a PRD, you must:

1. **Read the entire document thoroughly**
2. **Extract and list every feature/module**\
   *The PRD has eight core modules:*
   - Admissions portal - Decision e-mails - Rooms board - Residents & Occupancies
   - Fees & Payments - Maintenance list - Academic-year switch - Media gallery
3. **Categorise features by priority**
   - *Must-have*: the eight modules above
   - *Should-have*: Renewal form flow & rollover automation
   - *Nice-to-have*: Any feature not listed in scope (e.g. mobile app)
4. **Identify technical requirements and constraints**
   - Must stay **100 % on free tiers**
   - Read-only **Owner** role (no writes) vs **Manager** role (full writes)
   - Default academic year is **2024/25**
   - Landing page is public‑only; authenticated **Manager** and **Owner** users are redirected to the internal **Dashboard** by default.
   - Renewal form is accessible only via personalised link for **returning residents** (current occupants).
5. **Note integrations or dependencies**
   - Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage, Realtime, Edge Functions)
   - Next.js (deployed on Vercel free tier)
   - Resend (transactional e-mail)

### Step 2 – Feature Identification

For each feature identified:

- Provide a concise description
- Map it to the user story (Manager, Owner, Applicant, or Returning Resident)
- Flag technical complexity (Front-end, Back-end, or Full-stack)
- Note any special logic (e.g. Fee Matrix auto-fill, bed-badge renderer)

### Step 3 – Technology Stack Confirmation

**Do NOT search for alternative stacks**—the PRD fixes these:

| Layer                 | Tech             | Docs                                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Database/Auth/Storage | Supabase         | [https://supabase.com/docs](https://supabase.com/docs)                                                  |
| Front-end & Hosting   | Next.js + Vercel | [https://nextjs.org/docs](https://nextjs.org/docs) • [https://vercel.com/docs](https://vercel.com/docs) |
| Transactional Mail    | Resend           | [https://resend.com/docs](https://resend.com/docs)                                                      |

### Step 4 – Implementation Staging

Break the work into four stages:

1. **Foundation & Setup**
   - Repo, environment, Supabase project, CI/CD on Vercel
2. **Core Features**
   - Build the eight must-have modules
3. **Advanced Features**
   - Renewal form, rollover automation, Owner read-only UI
4. **Polish & Optimisation**
   - UI/UX refinement, accessibility (WCAG AA), testing & QA

### Step 5 – Detailed Implementation Plan

For each stage include:

- **Checkbox tasks** (`- [ ]`)
- **Effort estimate** (e.g. ½ d, 2 d)
- **Dependencies** (what must be done first)
- **Required resources** (roles or tools)

## Output File Organisation

Create these files inside `/Docs`:

```
/Docs
├── Implementation.md      # Full plan (all stages & tasks)
├── project_structure.md   # Folder & file architecture guidelines
├── UI_UX_doc.md           # Design system & UX flows
└── Bug_tracking.md        # Error logs & resolutions
```

**Implementation.md** must contain:

- Feature list & categorisation
- Stack confirmation table above
- Detailed implementation stages with checkboxes
- Timeline & dependencies

**project\_structure.md** must outline:

- Typical Next.js monorepo or app directory layout
- Location for Supabase client & hook, env files, tests, etc.

**UI\_UX\_doc.md** must cover:

- Responsive grid, colour tokens (cool colour palette – soft blues, teals, and complementary neutrals)
- Component guidelines (tables, badges, forms)
- Accessibility rules

**Bug\_tracking.md**:

- Error description → root cause → resolution

## Response Style

- Professional, concise, and technically accurate
- Justify decisions where helpful
- Keep timelines realistic within free-tier constraints
- Use clear links to docs
- Ensure all docs are internally consistent

*Remember: Your goal is a practical, step-by-step plan that any developer can follow to ship the ****Fredmak Hostel Dashboard**** on the specified free-tier stack.*

## 2. Workflow File – Development Agent Workflow (Cursor Rules)

Applies to **Docs/Implementation.md** tasks and project docs

```yaml
globs:
  - "Docs/Implementation.md"
alwaysApply: true
```

### Development Agent Workflow – Cursor Rules

**Primary Directive**\
You are a development agent implementing a project. Follow established documentation and maintain consistency.

#### Core Workflow Process

**Before Starting Any Task**

1. Consult `/Docs/Implementation.md` for current stage and available tasks
2. Check task dependencies and prerequisites
3. Verify scope understanding

**Task Execution Protocol**

1. **Task Assessment**

   - Read the subtask from `/Docs/Implementation.md`.
   - Assess its complexity:
     - *Simple subtask*: implement directly. If you think a certain simple task is not simple, break it into a short todo list. 
     - *Complex subtask*: create a short todo list.

2. **Documentation Research**

   - Check `/Docs/Implementation.md` for relevant links.
   - Read and understand documentation before coding.

3. **UI/UX Implementation**

   - Consult `/Docs/UI_UX_doc.md` before implementing any UI/UX elements.
   - Follow design system and responsive requirements.

4. **Project Structure Compliance**

   - Check `/Docs/project_structure.md` before creating files/folders, adding dependencies, or running project commands.

5. **Error Diagnosis**

   - Search `/Docs/Bug_tracking.md` for similar issues.
   - If a match is found, follow documented resolution steps.

6. **Error Documentation**

   - After fixing an error, append to `/Docs/Bug_tracking.md`:
     - Error description
     - Root cause
     - Resolution steps

7. **Task Completion**\
   Mark tasks complete only when:

   - All functionality is implemented and tested
   - Code follows project structure guidelines
   - UI/UX matches specifications (if applicable)
   - No errors or warnings remain
   - All checklist items are done

#### File Reference Priority

1. `/Docs/Bug_tracking.md`
2. `/Docs/Implementation.md`
3. `/Docs/project_structure.md`
4. `/Docs/UI_UX_doc.md`

#### Critical Rules

- **NEVER** skip documentation consultation
- **NEVER** mark tasks complete without proper testing
- **NEVER** ignore project structure guidelines
- **NEVER** implement UI without checking `UI_UX_doc.md`
- **NEVER** fix errors without checking `Bug_tracking.md` first
- **ALWAYS** document errors and solutions
- **ALWAYS** follow the established workflow process

*Remember: Build a cohesive, well-documented, and maintainable project. Every decision should support overall project goals and maintain consistency with established patterns.*
